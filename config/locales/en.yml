# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

#CONTENT
  about1: "First of all thank you very much for your attention presenting and honoring the Bugacku Fashion 

products and their world.

The Bugacku is more than a brand name, it is also a feeling. It is a sensation revealing your genuine face 

to the world and your reality. 

A cloth and an accessory present everybody with different feelings. It makes them unique. 

I, the creator of Bugacku Fashion have thought of contribution to attractiveness and virtue since my 

childhood.  I have known that I cannot offer my assistance to everybody but I have desired to give the 

most wondering and thinking of wishing for fascination of smile on faces and hearts. 

The years have lapsed and I looked for the solution. And suddenly, in a morning I got up with a question: 

“Why do not you do what you really enjoy? That is to give creation.”

Thus I found the answer to my question: my great dream of my life is fashion designing.

Every lady likes wearing nice cloths and beaming self confidence.

I know that a fabulous cloth can make miracle. 

The origin our future vision, faith and mission is there. 

Yours sincerely

Morena Bugacku"
